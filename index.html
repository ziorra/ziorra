    <h1>NOTE</h1>
    <h2>How to attract the right girl</h2>
    <h3>Complete guide by your sis ayesha</h3>
    <pre><p>first of all im gona tell u what i feel about you, which lead me to write this note.
        you are a nice generous and gentle boy/man which a girl find comfert in and some other good stuff!
        any ways
        1.correct posture. because it hakes you stand out and more dominant
        2.being jacked girls feels secure with strong men some extra details: try to get the V shaped body, main muscle groups
        are sholders chest triseps. last but not least the BACK. girls love great sculpted back on a guy.
        3.be confident, being confidnt is what it takes to secure a girl in ur bag. I kind of want to deep dive in this topic
        but Im just trying to give an idea hear
        4.stat clean/smell good/talk less listen to her more often if she say, Am I looking good you should always say YES! because
        the reason she asked at the first place is to hear YES! even if she is looking like a upside monkey (I love my dark humor BTW)
        5.Try to keep your testosterone as high as possible (WTH is that you might be asking) its a chemical that makes you more of a men
        the more u have it the more girls attracted to you its a super power
