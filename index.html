    <h1>NOTE</h1>
    <h2>How to attract the right girl</h2>
    <h3>Complete guide by your sis ayesha</h3>
    <pre><p>first of all im gona tell u what i feel about you, which lead me to write this note.
        you are a nice generous and gentle boy/man which a girl find comfert in and some other good stuff!
        any ways
        1.correct posture. because it hakes you stand out 
        2.being jacked girls feels secure with strong men some extra details: try to get the V shaped body, main muscle groups
        are sholders chest triseps. last but not least the BACK. girls love great sculpted back on a guy.
        3.be confident, being confidnt is what it takes to secure a girl in ur bag. I kind of want to deep dive in this topic
        but Im just trying to give an idea hear
        4.stat clean/smell good/talk less listen to her more often if she say, Am I looking good you should always say YES! because
        the reason she asked at the first place is to hear YES! even if she is looking like a upside monkey (I love my dark humor BTW)
        5.
